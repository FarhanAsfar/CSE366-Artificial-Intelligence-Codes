This repository contains codes of some of the topics of Artificial Intelligence.
The prbolems are solved using C++ language.
Each of the topics will have a **'guide'** file to give an idea about the problem and how the problem is solved.

This repository will contain the following topics-

1. A Star Search Algorithm.
2. Genetic Algorithm.
3. Bayesian Algorithm.
4. Naive Bayesian Algorithm.
5. Neural Network.
6.
